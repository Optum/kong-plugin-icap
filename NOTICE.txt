Kong-Plugin-Icap
Copyright 2021 Optum

Project Description:
====================
This project provides the basic framework of a kong plugin that enables virus scanning functionality leveraging the ICAP protocol. 
Sitting in the access phase of an API Gateway, the plugin will read file attachment data on a given payload, and send it via a TCP 
socket connection to a third party server (an ICAP server) to conduct the resource-heavy virus scanning. An ICAP response will be 
returned to the plugin, where logic will run to drop the request or allow it passage, depending on the results of the scan.
